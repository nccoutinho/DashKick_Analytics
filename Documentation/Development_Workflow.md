# Dashkick Analytics Development Workflow

## Introduction

Welcome to the development workflow guide for the `dashkickAnalytics` package. This document outlines the procedures and best practices for contributing to the development of the package. By following this workflow, you can ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

## Version Control

We use Git for version control. The main repository for the `dashkickAnalytics` package is hosted on GitHub at [link_to_your_repository]. Contributors should clone the repository to their local machine and work on feature branches.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a branching strategy to manage development work:

- `main`: The main branch is the stable branch containing production-ready code. All development work should be based on feature branches.
- Feature Branches: Contributors should create feature branches from the `main` branch for each new feature or bug fix. Branch names should be descriptive and prefixed with `feature/` or `bugfix/`.

## Pull Requests

When a feature or bug fix is complete, contributors should create a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the `main` branch. PRs should include:

- A descriptive title and summary of the changes.
- Any related issue references.
- Properly formatted and documented code.
- Passing tests.

## Code Review

All PRs require at least one code review before merging. Reviewers should ensure that:

- The code follows the project's coding standards and style guidelines.
- The changes address the stated issue or feature requirements.
- Tests adequately cover the changes, and documentation is updated if necessary.

## Testing

We have a comprehensive testing suite for the `dashkickAnalytics` package. Contributors should write unit tests for new features and bug fixes using the appropriate testing framework. Tests should cover edge cases and ensure code reliability and robustness.

## Release Management

Releases of the `dashkickAnalytics` package are managed using semantic versioning. After merging changes into the `main` branch, the package version is incremented according to the significance of the changes (major, minor, patch). Release notes are updated with details of the changes included in each release.

## Conclusion

Following this development workflow will help maintain consistency, quality, and stability in the `dashkickAnalytics` package. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
